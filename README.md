# guess-word-game
To create a guess word game using C++ programming.
The project aim is to create a word guessing game where:

- The computer randomly selects a word from a predefined list.
- The player is presented with a blank spaces representation of the word, with some letters already filled in.
- The player has a limited number of attempts (6 tries) to guess the word by suggesting letters.
- After each guess, the computer provides feedback in the form of:
    - Filling in the correct letters in the blank spaces.
    - Reducing the number of remaining tries for incorrect guesses.
- The game ends when the player either correctly guesses the word or runs out of tries.

The goal is to create an interactive and engaging game that challenges the player's vocabulary and guessingÂ skills.
